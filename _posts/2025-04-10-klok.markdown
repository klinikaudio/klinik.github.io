Klok is a cross-platform application developed around 2016 that combines a Euclidean rhythm based sequencer and a live coding environment designed for real-time sample transformation and effects processing. At the core of Klok is a meta sequencer that sequences ‘snapshots’ (groups of 4 Euclidean rhythm sequences). These snapshots have their own tempo and the meta sequencer its own global tempo.

Each of these 4 Euclidean sequences controls a channel and each of these channels has an associated audio sample connected to it (which can be hot-swapped programmatically whenever a block of code is called from a snapshot by the meta sequencer).

The live coding environment (based on an extended version of the Java QScript library) allows for control of sample playback parameters such as pitch and loop points as well as a suite of built in effects (low-pass and comb filters, reverb, etc). States such as the meta sequencer’s step position can be used as variables. When combined with the meta sequencer’s self randomisation function, some interesting generative capabilities are possible. MIDI and OSC control is also supported.

For technical reasons the development of this application has now ceased. Work is now underway to redevelop Klok from the ground up, maintaining the core paradigm of poly-rhythmic/poly-temporal sequencing of DSP code blocks.
